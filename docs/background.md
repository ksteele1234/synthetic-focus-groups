# Synthetic Focus Groups Platform - Project Scope & Layout

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Vision Statement
Create an affordable synthetic focus group platform for small marketing agencies, delivering data-driven customer insights when traditional research budgets aren't available—positioned as "better than guessing" rather than a replacement for enterprise research.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Primary Problem**: Small agencies ($50K-500K revenue) can't afford $500+ real focus groups but need customer insights better than pure intuition.
- **Solution**: AI-generated personas conducting realistic focus group discussions for $19-97/month.
- **Key Benefit**: Structured customer insights in 30 minutes vs. weeks, at 95% cost savings vs. traditional research.

### Success Metrics
- **User Adoption**: 100 small agencies within 6 months
- **User Satisfaction**: 80%+ report insights "better than no research"
- **Business Model**: $25K MRR within 12 months
- **Quality Threshold**: 70%+ correlation with available real data benchmarks
