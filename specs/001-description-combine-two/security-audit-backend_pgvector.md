# Security Audit Report: src/vector/backend_pgvector.py

## Summary
This report documents security findings and recommended remediation steps for `src/vector/backend_pgvector.py`.

## Findings
- Credential handling: Ensure credentials are not hardcoded and are loaded securely from environment variables or config files.
- SQL injection: Review all SQL queries for parameterization; avoid string interpolation in queries.
- Permissions: Confirm database user has only necessary privileges (least privilege principle).
- Error handling: Ensure errors do not leak sensitive information.

## Remediation Steps
1. Refactor credential loading to use environment variables/config.
2. Update all SQL queries to use parameterized statements.
3. Review and restrict database user permissions.
4. Audit error handling for sensitive data exposure.

## Next Actions
- Assign refactor to responsible developer.
- Add security tests to integration suite.
- Document changes in refactor checklist.
